<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many other improvements have been made.
See the “New and Updated Features” section below for more details.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_new_and_updated_features">New and Updated Features</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following features are either new or have been significantly updated since version 4.4.0:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Windows installers now ship with Npcap 1.80.
They previously shipped with Npcap 1.79.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Windows installers now ship with Qt 6.8.1.
They previously shipped with Qt 6.5.3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WinPcap is no longer supported. On Windows, use Npcap instead, uninstalling
WinPcap if necessary. The last release ever of WinPcap, 4.1.3, was on
2013-03-08 and only supports up to Windows 8, which is no longer supported
by Microsoft or Wireshark.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Source packages are now compressed using zstd.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Live captures can be compressed while writing. (Previously there was
support for compressing when performing multiple file capture, at file
rotation time.) The <code>--compress</code> option in TShark works on live captures
as well. <a href="https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/9311"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Absolute time fields, regardless of field display in the Packet Details,
are always written in ISO 8601 format in UTC with -T json. This was already
the case for -T ek since version 4.2.0. JSON is primarily a data interchange
format read by software, so a standard format is desirable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When absolute times field are output with -T fields, the "show" field of -T
pdml, or in custom columns (including CSV output of columns), the formatting
similar to asctime (e.g., Dec 18, 2017 05:28:39.071704055 EST) has been
deprecated in favor of ISO 8601. For backwards compatibility, a preference
has been added, protocols.display_abs_time_ascii, which can be set to continue
to format times as before. This preference can also be set to never use ASCII
time and to use ISO 8601 time formatting in the protocol tree (Packet Details)
as well. It is possible that a future release will remove the ascitime style
formatting entirely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UTC frame time column formats (including "Time (format as specified)" when
a UTC time display format is selected) have a "Z" suffix per ISO 8601. Local
time formats remain unqualified (including if the local time zone is UTC.)
Custom columns displaying FT_ABSOLUTE_TIME already had time zone indication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The TShark <code>-G</code> option for generating glossary reports does not need to be the
first option given on the command line anymore. In addition, the reports now
are affected by other command line options such as <code>-o</code>, <code>-d</code>, and
<code>--disable-protocol</code>, in addition to the <code>-C</code> option, which was already supported.
(The <code>defaultprefs</code> report remains unaffected by any other options.)
As a part of this change, <code>-G</code> with no argument, which was previously deprecated,
is no longer supported. Use <code>tshark -G fields</code> to produce the same report.
Also, the syntax for only listing fields with a certain prefix has changed to
<code>tshark -G fields,prefix</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The underlying type of EUI-64 fields has been switched to bytes when packet
matching, similar to most other address formats. This means that EUI-64
addresses can be sliced and compared to other bytes types, e.g. the filter
<code>wpan.src64[:3] == eth.src[:3]</code>. Fields can still be specified using 64-bit
unsigned integer literals, though arithmetic with other integers is no longer
supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wireshark can now decrypt NTP packets using NTS (Network Time Security). To decrypt packets,
the NTS-KE (Network Time Security Key Establishment Protocol) packets need to be present,
alongside the TLS client and exporter secrets. Additionally, the parts of a NTP packet which
can be cryptographically authenticated (from NTP packet header until the end  of the last
extension field that precedes the NTS Authenticator and Encrypted Extension Fields
extension field) are checked for validity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wiresharks' capability to decrypt MACsec packets has been expanded to either
use the SAK unwrapped by the MKA dissector, or the PSK configured in the
MACsec dissector. To enable the MKA dissector to unwrap the SAK, the CAK for
the applicable CKN can be entered in the extended CKN/CAK Info UAT in the
MKA dissector preferences. The ability of the MACsec dissector to decrypt
packets using a PSK has been extended to a list of PSKs, which can entered
through a new UAT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The TCP Stream Graph axes now use units with SI prefixes. <a href="https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/20197"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Custom columns have an option to show the values using the same format as
in Packet Details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Custom column complex expressions (e.g., with arithmetic, filter functions,
etc.) that return numeric results are sorted numerically instead of
lexicographically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A display filter function <code>double</code> is added to allow explicitly converting
field types like integers and times to doubles. This can be used to perform
further arithmetic operations on fields of different types, including in
custom column definitions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The minimum width of the I/O Graph dialog window is reduced, so it should
work better on small resolution desktops, especially in certain languages.
To enable this, some checkbox controls were moved to the graph right-click
context menu. <a href="https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/20147"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>X.509 certificates, used in TLS and elsewhere, can be exported via the
File&#8594;Export Objects menu in Wireshark (under the name "X509AF") and
<code>--export-objects</code> in TShark (with the protocol name <code>x509af</code>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zstandard Content-Encoding is supported in the HTTP and HTTP/2 dissectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow Stream is supported for MPEG 2 Transport Stream PIDs, and for
Packetized Elementary Streams contained within MPEG 2 TS. The latter
can be used to extract audio or video for playback with other tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DNP 3 (Distributed Network Protocol 3) is now supported in the Conversations
and Endpoints table dialogs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Lua supplied preloaded libraries <code>bit</code> and <code>rex_pcre2</code> are loaded in
a way that adds them to the <code>package.loaded</code> table, as though through
<code>require</code>, so that <code>require("bit")</code> and <code>require("rex_pcre2")</code> statements
in Lua dissectors, while usually superfluous, behave as expected. <a href="https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/20213"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The packet list (Wireshark) and event list (Stratoshark) no longer support rows with multiple lines.
<a href="https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/14424"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>ethers</code> file can also contain EUI-64 to name mappings. <a href="https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/15487"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wireshark "Import from Hex Dump" and text2pcap support byte groups with 2 to
4 bytes (with an option for little-endian byte order), and support hexadecimal
offsets with a <code>0x</code> or <code>0X</code> prefix (as produced by <code>tcpdump -x</code>, among others).
<a href="https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/16193"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frame timestamps can be added as preamble to hex dumps in Wireshark from
the "Print" and "Export Packet Dissection" dialogs, and in TShark with
the <code>--hexdump time</code> option. <a href="https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/17132"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lua now has a <code>Conversation</code> object, which exposes conversations and conversation
data to Lua. Resolves <a href="https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/15396"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supports "Copy in HTML" format via main menu, context menu and keyboard
shortcut. It also provides an option (via knobs in preferences) to copy plain
text with aligned columns along with an ability to select a copy format to be
used when copied via keyboard shortcut.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The "no duplicate keys" version of JSON output that tshark has supported
since 2.6.0 is available through the GUI Export Dissections Dialog.
Note that this format does not necessarily preserve the ordering of all
children in a tree, if sibling with identical keys are not consecutive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The GUI Export Dissections Dialog can output raw hex bytes of the frame
data for each field with or without exporting the field values, the same
formats as the "-T json -x" and "-T jsonraw" output modes, respectively,
of TShark.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Conversations and Endpoints dialogs have an option to display byte counts
and bit rates in exact counts instead of human-readable numbers with SI units.
The default setting when opening a dialog is controlled by a Statistics
preference, "conv.machine_readable". The same preference controls whether
precise byte counts are used in the TShark "-z conv" and "-z endpoints" taps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The output format for some TShark statistics taps (those selected with
"-z &lt;tap&gt;,tree", which use the stats_tree system) can be controlled via
a preference "-o statistics.output_format".</p>
</li>
</ul>
