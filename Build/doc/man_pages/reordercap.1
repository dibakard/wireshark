.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBReordercap\fP is a program that reads an input capture file and rewrites the
frames to an output capture file, but with the frames sorted by increasing
timestamp.
.sp
This functionality may be useful when capture files have been created by
combining frames from more than one well\-synchronised source, but the
frames have not been combined in strict time order.
.sp
\fBReordercap\fP writes the output capture file in the same format as the input
capture file.
.sp
\fBReordercap\fP is able to detect, read and write the same capture files that
are supported by \fBWireshark\fP.
The input file doesn\(cqt need a specific filename extension; the file
format and an optional gzip, zstd or lz4 compression will be automatically detected.
Near the beginning of the DESCRIPTION section of wireshark(1) or
\c
.URL "https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man\-pages/wireshark.html" ""
is a detailed description of the way \fBWireshark\fP handles this, which is
the same way \fBreordercap\fP handles this.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-h|\-\-help
.RS 4
Print the version number and options and exit.
.RE
.sp
\-n
.RS 4
When the \fB\-n\fP option is used, \fBreordercap\fP will not write out the output
file if it finds that the input file is already in order.
.RE
.sp
\-v|\-\-version
.RS 4
Print the full version information and exit.
.RE
.SH "DIAGNOSTIC OPTIONS"
.sp
\-\-log\-level <level>
.RS 4
Set the active log level.
Supported levels in lowest to highest order are "noisy", "debug", "info", "message", "warning", "critical", and "error".
Messages at each level and higher will be printed, for example "warning" prints "warning", "critical", and "error" messages and "noisy" prints all messages.
Levels are case insensitive.
.RE
.sp
\-\-log\-fatal <level>
.RS 4
Abort the program if any messages are logged at the specified level or higher.
For example, "warning" aborts on any "warning", "critical", or "error" messages.
.RE
.sp
\-\-log\-domains <list>
.RS 4
Only print messages for the specified log domains, e.g. "GUI,Epan,sshdump".
List of domains must be comma\-separated. Can be negated with "!" as the first character (inverts the match).
.RE
.sp
\-\-log\-debug <list>
.RS 4
Force the specified domains to log at the "debug" level.
List of domains must be comma\-separated. Can be negated with "!" as the first character (inverts the match).
.RE
.sp
\-\-log\-noisy <list>
.RS 4
Force the specified domains to log at the "noisy" level.
List of domains must be comma\-separated. Can be negated with "!" as the first character (inverts the match).
.RE
.sp
\-\-log\-fatal\-domains <list>
.RS 4
Abort the program if any messages are logged for the specified log domains.
List of domains must be comma\-separated.
.RE
.sp
\-\-log\-file <path>
.RS 4
Write log messages and stderr output to the specified file.

.SH "NOTES"
.sp
This is the manual page for \fBReordercap\fP 4.5.0.
\fBReordercap\fP is part of the \fBWireshark\fP distribution.
The latest version of \fBWireshark\fP can be found at \c
.URL "https://www.wireshark.org" "" "."
.sp
It may make sense to move this functionality into \fBeditcap\fP, or perhaps \fBmergecap\fP, in which case \fBreordercap\fP could be retired.
