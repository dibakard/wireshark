<h2 id="_description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stratoshark</strong> is a GUI system call and log analyzer.
It lets you interactively browse system calls and log messages from a live system or from a previously saved capture file.
<strong>Stratoshark</strong>'s native capture file format is <strong>scap</strong>, which is used by the sysdig CLI tool and by Falco.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stratoshark</strong>'s main window shows 3 views of each event.
It shows a summary line, briefly describing what the event is.
An event details display is shown, allowing you to drill down to exact field that you interested in.
Finally, a hex dump shows you exactly what the event data looks like on disk or over the wire.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, <strong>Stratoshark</strong> has some features that make it unique.
It can assemble all the syscalls in a file descriptor stream and show you the ASCII (or EBCDIC, or hex) data in that conversation.
Display filters in <strong>Stratoshark</strong> are very powerful; more fields are filterable in <strong>Stratoshark</strong> than in other tools, and the syntax you can use to create your filters is richer.
As <strong>Stratoshark</strong> progresses, expect more and more fields to be supported.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Event capturing is performed by the libscap and libsinsp libraries.
The capture filter syntax follows the rules of the libscap.
This syntax is different from the display filter syntax.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Compressed file support uses (and therefore requires) the zlib library.
If the zlib library is not present, <strong>Stratoshark</strong> will compile, but will be unable to read compressed files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The pathname of a capture file to be read can be specified with the
<strong>-r</strong> option or can be specified as a command-line argument.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_options">OPTIONS</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stratoshark</strong> supports a wide variety of command line options.
Most users will want to start it without any options and configure it from the application menus instead.
Those users may wish to skip this section.</p>

<div class="openblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Specify a criterion that specifies when <strong>Stratoshark</strong> should stop writing
to a capture file.  The criterion is of the form <em>test:value</em>,
where <em>test</em> is one of:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>duration</strong>:<em>value</em> Stop writing to a capture file after <em>value</em> seconds have
elapsed. Floating point values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>files</strong>:<em>value</em> Stop writing to capture files after <em>value</em> number of files
were written.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>filesize</strong>:<em>value</em> Stop writing to a capture file after it reaches a size of
<em>value</em> kB.  If this option is used together with the -b option, Stratoshark
will stop writing to the current capture file and switch to the next one if
filesize is reached.  Note that the filesize is limited to a maximum value of
2 TB, although you might have problems viewing the file in the GUI before then if
the number of events exceeds 2<sup>31</sup> (2147483648).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>events</strong>:<em>value</em> Stop writing to a capture file after it contains <em>value</em> events.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cause <strong>Stratoshark</strong> to run in "multiple files" mode.  In "multiple files" mode,
<strong>Stratoshark</strong> will write to several capture files.  When the first capture file
fills up, <strong>Stratoshark</strong> will switch writing to the next file and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The created filenames are based on the filename given with the <strong>-w</strong> flag,
the number of the file and on the creation date and time,
e.g. outfile_00001_20250714120117.pcap, outfile_00002_20250714120523.pcap, &#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the <em>files</em> option it&#8217;s also possible to form a "ring buffer".
This will fill up new files until the number of files specified,
at which point <strong>Stratoshark</strong> will discard the data in the first file and start
writing to that file and so on.  If the <em>files</em> option is not set,
new files filled up until one of the capture stop conditions match (or
until the disk is full).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The criterion is of the form <em>key:value</em>,
where <em>key</em> is one of:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>duration</strong>:<em>value</em> switch to the next file after <em>value</em> seconds have
elapsed, even if the current file is not completely filled up. Floating
point values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>files</strong>:<em>value</em> begin again with the first file after <em>value</em> number of
files were written (form a ring buffer).  This value must be less than 100000.
Caution should be used when using large numbers of files: some filesystems do
not handle many files in a single directory well.  The <strong>files</strong> criterion
requires one of the other criteria to be specified to
control when to go to the next file.  It should be noted that each <strong>-b</strong>
parameter takes exactly one criterion; to specify two criteria, each must be
preceded by the <strong>-b</strong> option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>filesize</strong>:<em>value</em> switch to the next file after it reaches a size of
<em>value</em> kB.  Note that the filesize is limited to a maximum value of 2 TB,
although you might have problems viewing the file in the GUI before then if
the number of events exceeds 2<sup>31</sup> (2147483648).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>interval</strong>:<em>value</em> switch to the next file when the time is an exact
multiple of <em>value</em> seconds.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>events</strong>:<em>value</em> switch to the next file after it contains <em>value</em> events.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Example: <strong>-b filesize:1000 -b files:5</strong> results in a ring buffer of five files

<p>Wireshark looks for plugins in both a personal plugin folder and a
global plugin folder.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On UNIX-compatible systems, such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and
AIX, the global plugin directory is <em>lib/wireshark/plugins/</em> (on
some systems substitute <em>lib64</em> for <em>lib</em>) under the main installation
directory (for example, <em>/usr/local/lib/wireshark/plugins/</em>). The personal
plugin directory is <em>$HOME/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On macOS, if Wireshark is installed as an application bundle, the global plugin
folder is instead <em>%APPDIR%/Contents/PlugIns/wireshark</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On Windows, the global plugin folder is <em>plugins/</em> under the main
installation directory (for example, <em>C:\Program Files\Wireshark\plugins\</em>).
The personal plugin folder is <em>%APPDATA%\Wireshark\plugins</em> (or, if
%APPDATA% isn&#8217;t defined, <em>%USERPROFILE%\Application Data\Wireshark\plugins</em>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lua plugins are stored in the plugin folders;
compiled plugins are stored in subfolders of the plugin folders, with
the subfolder name being the Wireshark minor version number (X.Y). There is
another hierarchical level for each Wireshark plugin type (libwireshark,
libwiretap and codecs).  For example, the location for a libwireshark plugin
<em>foo.so</em> (<em>foo.dll</em> on Windows) would be <em>PLUGINDIR/X.Y/epan</em>
(libwireshark used to be called libepan; the other folder names are <em>codecs</em>
and <em>wiretap</em>).</p>

there is not necessarily a one-to-one correspondence between dissector plugin

<p>This environment variable overrides the location of personal
configuration files.  On UNIX-compatible systems, such as Linux, macOS,
\*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, it defaults to <em>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireshark</em>
(or, if that directory doesn&#8217;t exist but <em>$HOME/.wireshark</em> does
exist, <em>$HOME/.wireshark</em>); this is typically
<em>$HOME/.config/wireshark</em>.  On Windows, it defaults to
<em>%APPDATA%\Wireshark</em> (or, if %APPDATA% isn&#8217;t defined,
<em>%USERPROFILE%\Application Data\Wireshark</em>).  Available since
Wireshark 3.0.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_DEBUG_WMEM_OVERRIDE</dt>
<dd>
<p>Setting this environment variable forces the wmem framework to use the
specified allocator backend for <strong>all</strong> allocations, regardless of which
backend is normally specified by the code. This is mainly useful to developers
when testing or debugging. See <em>README.wmem</em> in the source distribution for
details.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY</dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable causes the plugins and other data files to be
loaded from the build directory (where the program was compiled) rather
than from the standard locations.  It has no effect when the program in
question is running with root (or setuid) permissions on UNIX-compatible
systems, such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_DATA_DIR</dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable causes the various data files to be loaded from
a directory other than the standard locations.  It has no effect when the
program in question is running with root (or setuid) permissions on
UNIX-compatible systems.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_EXTCAP_DIR</dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable causes the various extcap programs and scripts
to be run from a directory other than the standard locations.  It has no
effect when the program in question is running with root (or setuid)
permissions on UNIX-compatible systems.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_PLUGIN_DIR</dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable causes the various plugins to be loaded from
a directory other than the standard locations.  It has no effect when the
program in question is running with root (or setuid) permissions on
UNIX-compatible systems.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_DISSECTOR_BUG</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this environment variable is set, <strong>Stratoshark</strong> will call abort(3)
when a dissector bug is encountered.  abort(3) will cause the program to
exit abnormally; if you are running <strong>Stratoshark</strong> in a debugger, it
should halt in the debugger and allow inspection of the process, and, if
you are not running it in a debugger, it will, on some OSes, assuming
your environment is configured correctly, generate a core dump file.
This can be useful to developers attempting to troubleshoot a problem
with a protocol dissector.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_TOO_MANY_ITEMS</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this environment variable is set, <strong>Stratoshark</strong> will call abort(3)
if a dissector tries to add too many items to a tree (generally this
is an indication of the dissector not breaking out of a loop soon enough).
abort(3) will cause the program to exit abnormally; if you are running
<strong>Stratoshark</strong> in a debugger, it should halt in the debugger and allow
inspection of the process, and, if you are not running it in a debugger,
it will, on some OSes, assuming your environment is configured correctly,
generate a core dump file.  This can be useful to developers attempting to
troubleshoot a problem with a protocol dissector.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_QUIT_AFTER_CAPTURE</dt>
<dd>
<p>Cause <strong>Stratoshark</strong> to exit after the end of the capture session.  This
doesn&#8217;t automatically start a capture; you must still use <strong>-k</strong> to do
that.  You must also specify an autostop condition, e.g.  <strong>-c</strong> or <strong>-a
duration:&#8230;&#8203;</strong>.  This means that you will not be able to see the results
of the capture after it stops; it&#8217;s primarily useful for testing.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_LOG_LEVEL</dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable controls the verbosity of diagnostic messages to
the console. From less verbose to most verbose levels can be <code>critical</code>,
<code>warning</code>, <code>message</code>, <code>info</code>, <code>debug</code> or <code>noisy</code>. Levels above the
current level are also active. Levels <code>critical</code> and <code>error</code> are always
active.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_LOG_FATAL</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the fatal log level. Fatal log levels cause the program to abort.
This level can be set to <code>Error</code>, <code>critical</code> or <code>warning</code>. <code>Error</code> is
always fatal and is the default.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_LOG_DOMAINS</dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable selects which log domains are active. The filter is
given as a case-insensitive comma separated list. If set only the included
domains will be enabled. The default domain is always considered to be enabled.
Domain filter lists can be preceded by '!' to invert the sense of the match.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_LOG_DEBUG</dt>
<dd>
<p>List of domains with <code>debug</code> log level. This sets the level of the provided
log domains and takes precedence over the active domains filter. If preceded
by '!' this disables the <code>debug</code> level instead.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_LOG_NOISY</dt>
<dd>
<p>Same as above but for <code>noisy</code> log level instead.</p>
