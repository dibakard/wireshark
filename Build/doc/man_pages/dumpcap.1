\fB\-v|\-\-version\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBDumpcap\fP is a network traffic dump tool.  It lets you capture packet
data from a live network and write the packets to a file.  \fBDumpcap\fP\*(Aqs
default capture file format is \fBpcapng\fP format. The \fB\-F\fP option can
be specified to write the output file in the \fBpcap\fP format instead.
.sp
Without any options set it will use the libpcap or Npcap library to
capture traffic from the first available network interface and writes
the received raw packet data, along with the packets\*(Aq time stamps into a
capture file.
.sp
If the \fB\-w\fP option is not specified, \fBDumpcap\fP writes to a newly
created capture file with a randomly chosen name.
If the \fB\-w\fP option is specified, \fBDumpcap\fP writes to the file
specified by that option.
.sp
Packet capturing is performed with the pcap library.  The capture filter
syntax follows the rules of the pcap library.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-a|\-\-autostop  <capture autostop condition>
.RS 4
.sp
Specify a criterion that specifies when \fBDumpcap\fP is to stop writing
to a capture file.  The criterion is of the form \fItest:value\fP,
where \fItest\fP is one of:
.sp
\fBduration\fP:\fIvalue\fP Stop writing to a capture file after \fIvalue\fP seconds have
elapsed. Floating point values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.
.sp
\fBfiles\fP:\fIvalue\fP Stop writing to capture files after \fIvalue\fP number of files
were written.
.sp
\fBfilesize\fP:\fIvalue\fP Stop writing to a capture file after it reaches a size of
\fIvalue\fP kB. If this option is used together with the \-b option, dumpcap will
stop writing to the current capture file and switch to the next one if filesize
is reached.  Note that the filesize is limited to a maximum value of 2 TB.
.sp
\fBpackets\fP:\fIvalue\fP Stop writing to a capture file after \fIvalue\fP packets
have been written. Acts the same as \fB\-c\fP <capture packet count>.
.RE
.sp
\-b|\-\-ring\-buffer  <capture ring buffer option>
.RS 4
.sp
Cause \fBDumpcap\fP to run in "multiple files" mode.  In "multiple files" mode,
\fBDumpcap\fP will write to several capture files. When the first capture file
fills up, \fBDumpcap\fP will switch writing to the next file and so on.
.sp
The created filenames are based on the filename given with the \fB\-w\fP
option, the number of the file and on the creation date and time, e.g.
outfile_00001_20250714120117.pcapng,
outfile_00002_20250714120523.pcapng, ...
.sp
With the \fIfiles\fP option it\(cqs also possible to form a "ring buffer".
This will fill up new files until the number of files specified,
at which point \fBDumpcap\fP will discard the data in the first file and start
writing to that file and so on. If the \fIfiles\fP option is not set,
new files filled up until one of the capture stop conditions match (or
until the disk is full).
.sp
The criterion is of the form \fIkey:value\fP,
where \fIkey\fP is one of:
.sp
\fBduration\fP:\fIvalue\fP switch to the next file after \fIvalue\fP seconds have
elapsed, even if the current file is not completely filled up. Floating
point values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.
.sp
\fBfiles\fP:\fIvalue\fP begin again with the first file after \fIvalue\fP number of
files were written (form a ring buffer).  This value must be less than 100000.
Caution should be used when using large numbers of files: some filesystems do
not handle many files in a single directory well.  The \fBfiles\fP criterion
requires either \fBduration\fP, \fBinterval\fP or \fBfilesize\fP to be specified to
control when to go to the next file.  It should be noted that each \fB\-b\fP
parameter takes exactly one criterion; to specify two criterion, each must be
preceded by the \fB\-b\fP option.
.sp
\fBfilesize\fP:\fIvalue\fP switch to the next file after it reaches a size of
\fIvalue\fP kB.  Note that the filesize is limited to a maximum value of 2 TB.
.sp
\fBinterval\fP:\fIvalue\fP switch to the next file when the time is an exact
multiple of \fIvalue\fP seconds.  For example, use 3600 to switch to a new file
every hour on the hour.
.sp
\fBpackets\fP:\fIvalue\fP switch to the next file after it contains \fIvalue\fP
packets.
.sp
\fBprintname\fP:\fIfilename\fP print the name of the most recently written file
to \fIfilename\fP after the file is closed. \fIfilename\fP can be \f(CRstdout\fP or \f(CR\-\fP
for standard output, or \f(CRstderr\fP for standard error.
.sp
Example: \fB\-b filesize:1000 \-b files:5\fP results in a ring buffer of five files
of size one megabyte each.
.RE
.sp
\-B|\-\-buffer\-size  <capture buffer size>
.RS 4
.sp
Set capture buffer size (in MiB, default is 2 MiB).  This is used by
the capture driver to buffer packet data until that data can be written
to disk.  If you encounter packet drops while capturing, try to increase
this size.  Note that, while \fBDumpcap\fP attempts to set the buffer size
to 2 MiB by default, and can be told to set it to a larger value, the
system or interface on which you\(cqre capturing might silently limit the
capture buffer size to a lower value or raise it to a higher value.
.sp
This is available on UNIX\-compatible systems, such as Linux, macOS,
\(rs*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, with libpcap 1.0.0 or later, and on Windows.
It is not available on UNIX\-compatible systems with earlier versions of
libpcap.
.sp
This option can occur multiple times. If used before the first
occurrence of the \fB\-i\fP option, it sets the default capture buffer size.
If used after an \fB\-i\fP option, it sets the capture buffer size for
the interface specified by the last \fB\-i\fP option occurring before
this option. If the capture buffer size is not set specifically,
the default capture buffer size is used instead.
.RE
.sp
\-c  <capture packet count>
.RS 4
Set the maximum number of packets to read when capturing live
data. Acts the same as \fB\-a packets:\fP<capture packet count>.
.RE
.sp
\-C  <byte limit>
.RS 4
Limit the amount of memory in bytes used for storing captured packets
in memory while processing it.
If used in combination with the \fB\-N\fP option, both limits will apply.
Setting this limit will enable the usage of the separate thread per interface.
.RE
.sp
\-d
.RS 4
Dump the code generated for the capture filter in a human\-readable form,
and exit.
.RE
.sp
\-D|\-\-list\-interfaces
.RS 4
Print a list of the interfaces on which \fBDumpcap\fP can capture, and
exit.  For each network interface, a number and an interface name,
possibly followed by a text description of the interface, is printed.
The interface name or the number can be supplied to the \fB\-i\fP flag to
specify an interface on which to capture.  The number can be useful on
Windows systems, where the interfaces have long names that usually
contain a GUID.
.RE
.sp
\-f  <capture filter>
.RS 4
.sp
Set the capture filter expression.
.sp
The entire filter expression must be specified as a single argument (which means
that if it contains spaces, it must be quoted).
.sp
This option can occur multiple times. If used before the first
occurrence of the \fB\-i\fP option, it sets the default capture filter expression.
If used after an \fB\-i\fP option, it sets the capture filter expression for
the interface specified by the last \fB\-i\fP option occurring before
this option. If the capture filter expression is not set specifically,
the default capture filter expression is used if provided.
.RE
.sp
\-F  <file format>
.RS 4
Set the file format of the output capture file written using the \fB\-w\fP
option. In situations that require the \fBpcapng\fP format, such as capturing
from multiple interfaces, this option will be overridden. The option \fB\-F\fP
without a value will list the available formats. The default is the
\fBpcapng\fP format.
.RE
.sp
Fewer formats are supported than by tshark(1); this is
intentional for security reasons. Use \fBtshark\fP or capture and then convert
the file with editcap(1) if another format is needed.
.sp
\-g
.RS 4
This option causes the output file(s) to be created with group\-read permission
(meaning that the output file(s) can be read by other members of the calling
user\(cqs group).
.RE
.sp
\-h|\-\-help
.RS 4
Print the version number and options and exit.
.RE
.sp
\-i|\-\-interface  <capture interface>|rpcap://<host>:<port>/<capture interface>|TCP@<host>:<port>|\-
.RS 4
.sp
Set the name of the network interface or pipe to use for live packet
capture.
.sp
Network interface names should match one of the names listed in "\fBtshark
\-D\fP" (described above); a number, as reported by "\fBdumpcap \-D\fP", can
also be used.
.sp
If no interface is specified, \fBDumpcap\fP searches the list of
interfaces, choosing the first non\-loopback interface if there are any
non\-loopback interfaces, and choosing the first loopback interface if
there are no non\-loopback interfaces. If there are no interfaces at all,
\fBDumpcap\fP reports an error and doesn\(cqt start the capture.
.sp
Pipe names should be either the name of a FIFO (named pipe) or "\-" to
read data from the standard input.  On Windows systems, pipe names must be
of the form "\(rs\(rs.\(rspipe\(rs\fBpipename\fP".  Data read from pipes must be in
standard pcapng or pcap format. Pcapng data must have the same
endianness as the capturing host.
.sp
"TCP@<host>:<port>" causes \fBDumpcap\fP to attempt to connect to the
specified port on the specified host and read pcapng or pcap data.
.sp
This option can occur multiple times. When capturing from multiple
interfaces, the capture file will be saved in pcapng format, even if
\fB\-P\fP is specified.
.RE
.sp
\-\-ifdescr> <description>
.RS 4
Use \fIdescription\fP as the description in the capture file for the
interface or pipe specified before it with \fB\-i\fP.
.RE
.sp
\-\-ifname> <name>
.RS 4
Use \fIname\fP as the name in the capture file for the interface or
pipe specified before it with \fB\-i\fP.
.RE
.sp
\-I|\-\-monitor\-mode
.RS 4
.sp
Put the interface in "monitor mode"; this is supported only on IEEE
802.11 Wi\-Fi interfaces, and supported only on some operating systems.
.sp
Note that in monitor mode the adapter might disassociate from the
network with which it\(cqs associated, so that you will not be able to use
any wireless networks with that adapter.  This could prevent accessing
files on a network server, or resolving host names or network addresses,
if you are capturing in monitor mode and are not connected to another
network with another adapter.
.sp
This option can occur multiple times. If used before the first
occurrence of the \fB\-i\fP option, it enables the monitor mode for all interfaces.
If used after an \fB\-i\fP option, it enables the monitor mode for
the interface specified by the last \fB\-i\fP option occurring before
this option.

.sp
\-p|\-\-no\-promiscuous\-mode
.RS 4
.sp
\fIDon\(cqt\fP put the interface into promiscuous mode.  Note that the
interface might be in promiscuous mode for some other reason; hence,
\fB\-p\fP cannot be used to ensure that the only traffic that is captured is
traffic sent to or from the machine on which \fBDumpcap\fP is running,
broadcast traffic, and multicast traffic to addresses received by that
machine.
.sp
This option can occur multiple times. If used before the first
occurrence of the \fB\-i\fP option, no interface will be put into the
promiscuous mode.
If used after an \fB\-i\fP option, the interface specified by the last \fB\-i\fP
option occurring before this option will not be put into the
promiscuous mode.
.RE
.sp
