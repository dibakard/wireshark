.sp
\fBWireshark\fP is a GUI network protocol analyzer.  It lets you
interactively browse packet data from a live network or from a
previously saved capture file.  \fBWireshark\fP\*(Aqs native capture file
formats are \fBpcapng\fP format and \fBpcap\fP format; it can read and write
both formats..  \fBpcap\fP format is also the format used by \fBtcpdump\fP and
various other tools; \fBtcpdump\fP, when using newer versions of the
\fBlibpcap\fP library, can also read some pcapng files, and, on newer
versions of macOS, can read all pcapng files and can write them as well.
.sp
\fBWireshark\fP can also read / import the following file formats:

.RE
.sp
There is no need to tell \fBWireshark\fP what type of
file you are reading; it will determine the file type by itself.
\fBWireshark\fP is also capable of reading any of these file formats if they
are compressed using gzip, LZ4, or Zstandard, if compiled with the
appropriate support.  \fBWireshark\fP recognizes this directly from the file;
the \*(Aq.gz\*(Aq or other extension is not required for this purpose.
.sp
Like other protocol analyzers, \fBWireshark\fP\*(Aqs main window shows 3 views
of a packet.  It shows a summary line, briefly describing what the
packet is.  A packet details display is shown, allowing you to drill
down to exact protocol or field that you interested in.  Finally, a hex
dump shows you exactly what the packet looks like when it goes over the
wire.
.sp
In addition, \fBWireshark\fP has some features that make it unique.  It can
assemble all the packets in a TCP conversation and show you the ASCII
(or EBCDIC, or hex) data in that conversation.  Display filters in
\fBWireshark\fP are very powerful; more fields are filterable in \fBWireshark\fP
than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax you can use to create
your filters is richer.  As \fBWireshark\fP progresses, expect more and more
protocol fields to be allowed in display filters.
.sp
Packet capturing is performed with the pcap library.  The capture filter
syntax follows the rules of the pcap library.  This syntax is different
from the display filter syntax.
.sp
Compressed file support uses (and therefore requires) the zlib library.
If the zlib library is not present, \fBWireshark\fP will compile, but will
be unable to read compressed files.
.sp
The pathname of a capture file to be read can be specified with the
\fB\-r\fP option or can be specified as a command\-line argument.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fBWireshark\fP supports a wide variety of command line options.
Most users will want to start it without any options and configure it from the application menus instead.
Those users may wish to skip this section.
.sp
\-a|\-\-autostop  <capture autostop condition>
.RS 4
.sp
Specify a criterion that specifies when \fBWireshark\fP is to stop writing
to a capture file.  The criterion is of the form \fItest:value\fP,
where \fItest\fP is one of:
.sp
\fBduration\fP:\fIvalue\fP Stop writing to a capture file after \fIvalue\fP seconds have
elapsed. Floating point values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.
.sp
\fBfiles\fP:\fIvalue\fP Stop writing to capture files after \fIvalue\fP number of files
were written.
.sp
\fBfilesize\fP:\fIvalue\fP Stop writing to a capture file after it reaches a size of
\fIvalue\fP kB.  If this option is used together with the \-b option, Wireshark
will stop writing to the current capture file and switch to the next one if
filesize is reached.  Note that the filesize is limited to a maximum value of
2 TB, although you might have problems viewing the file in the GUI before then if
the number of packets exceeds 231 (2147483648).
.sp
\fBpackets\fP:\fIvalue\fP Stop writing to a capture file after it contains \fIvalue\fP
packets. Acts the same as \fB\-c\fP<capture packet count>.
.RE
.sp
\-b|\-\-ring\-buffer  <capture ring buffer option>
.RS 4
.sp
Cause \fBWireshark\fP to run in "multiple files" mode.  In "multiple files" mode,
\fBWireshark\fP will write to several capture files.  When the first capture file
fills up, \fBWireshark\fP will switch writing to the next file and so on.
.sp
The created filenames are based on the filename given with the \fB\-w\fP flag,
the number of the file and on the creation date and time,
e.g. outfile_00001_20250714120117.pcap, outfile_00002_20250714120523.pcap, ...
.sp
With the \fIfiles\fP option it\(cqs also possible to form a "ring buffer".
This will fill up new files until the number of files specified,
at which point \fBWireshark\fP will discard the data in the first file and start
writing to that file and so on.  If the \fIfiles\fP option is not set,
new files filled up until one of the capture stop conditions match (or
until the disk is full).
.sp
The criterion is of the form \fIkey:value\fP,
where \fIkey\fP is one of:
.sp
\fBduration\fP:\fIvalue\fP switch to the next file after \fIvalue\fP seconds have
elapsed, even if the current file is not completely filled up. Floating
point values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.
.sp
\fBfiles\fP:\fIvalue\fP begin again with the first file after \fIvalue\fP number of
files were written (form a ring buffer).  This value must be less than 100000.
Caution should be used when using large numbers of files: some filesystems do
not handle many files in a single directory well.  The \fBfiles\fP criterion
requires one of the other criteria to be specified to
control when to go to the next file.  It should be noted that each \fB\-b\fP
parameter takes exactly one criterion; to specify two criteria, each must be
preceded by the \fB\-b\fP option.
.sp
\fBfilesize\fP:\fIvalue\fP switch to the next file after it reaches a size of
\fIvalue\fP kB.  Note that the filesize is limited to a maximum value of 2 TB,
although you might have problems viewing the file in the GUI before then if
the number of packets exceeds 231 (2147483648).
.sp
\fBinterval\fP:\fIvalue\fP switch to the next file when the time is an exact
multiple of \fIvalue\fP seconds.
.sp
\fBpackets\fP:\fIvalue\fP switch to the next file after it contains \fIvalue\fP
packets.
.sp
Example: \fB\-b filesize:1000 \-b files:5\fP results in a ring buffer of five files
of size one megabyte each.
.RE
.sp
\-B|\-\-buffer\-size  <capture buffer size>
.RS 4
.sp
Set capture buffer size (in MiB, default is 2 MiB).  This is used by
the capture driver to buffer packet data until that data can be written
to disk.  If you encounter packet drops while capturing, try to increase
this size.  Note that, while \fBWireshark\fP attempts to set the buffer size
to 2 MiB by default, and can be told to set it to a larger value, the
system or interface on which you\(cqre capturing might silently limit the
capture buffer size to a lower value or raise it to a higher value.
.sp
This is available on UNIX\-compatible systems, such as Linux, macOS,
\(rs*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, with libpcap 1.0.0 or later, and on Windows.
It is not available on UNIX\-compatible systems with earlier versions of
libpcap.
.sp
This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the \fB\-i\fP option, it sets the default capture buffer size.
If used after an \fB\-i\fP option, it sets the capture buffer size for
the interface specified by the last \fB\-i\fP option occurring before
this option.  If the capture buffer size is not set specifically,
the default capture buffer size is used instead.

The interface name or the number can be supplied to the \fB\-i\fP flag to
specify an interface on which to capture.  The number can be useful on
Windows systems, where the interfaces have long names that usually
contain a GUID.

this option.  If the capture filter expression is not set specifically,
the default capture filter expression is used if provided.

Network interface names should match one of the names listed in "\fBwireshark
\-D\fP" (described above); a number, as reported by "\fBtshark \-D\fP", can also
be used.
.sp
If no interface is specified, \fBWireshark\fP searches the list of
interfaces, choosing the first non\-loopback interface if there are any
non\-loopback interfaces, and choosing the first loopback interface if
there are no non\-loopback interfaces.  If there are no interfaces at all,
\fBWireshark\fP reports an error and doesn\(cqt start the capture.
.sp
Pipe names should be either the name of a FIFO (named pipe) or "\-" to
read data from the standard input.  On Windows systems, pipe names must be
of the form "\(rs\(rs.\(rspipe\(rs\fBpipename\fP".  Data read from pipes must be in
standard pcapng or pcap format. Pcapng data must have the same
endianness as the capturing host.
.sp
"TCP@<host>:<port>" causes \fBWireshark\fP to attempt to connect to the
specified port on the specified host and read pcapng or pcap data.

.sp
Each line of this file consists of an IPv4 address, a subnet mask length
separated only by a / and a name separated by whitespace. While the address
must be a full IPv4 address, any values beyond the mask length are subsequently
ignored.
.sp
An example is:
.sp
# Comments must be prepended by the # sign!
192.168.0.0/24 ws_test_network
.sp
A partially matched name will be printed as "subnet\-name.remaining\-address".
For example, "192.168.0.1" under the subnet above would be printed as
"ws_test_network.1"; if the mask length above had been 16 rather than 24, the

WIRESHARK_EXTCAP_DIR
.RS 4
This environment variable causes the various extcap programs and scripts
to be run from a directory other than the standard locations.  It has no
effect when the program in question is running with root (or setuid)
permissions on UNIX\-compatible systems.

ERF_RECORDS_TO_CHECK
.RS 4
This environment variable controls the number of ERF records checked when
deciding if a file really is in the ERF format.  Setting this environment
variable a number higher than the default (20) would make false positives
less likely.

WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_DISSECTOR_BUG
.RS 4
If this environment variable is set, \fBWireshark\fP will call abort(3)
when a dissector bug is encountered.  abort(3) will cause the program to
exit abnormally; if you are running \fBWireshark\fP in a debugger, it
should halt in the debugger and allow inspection of the process, and, if
you are not running it in a debugger, it will, on some OSes, assuming
your environment is configured correctly, generate a core dump file.
This can be useful to developers attempting to troubleshoot a problem
with a protocol dissector.
.RE
.sp
WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_TOO_MANY_ITEMS
.RS 4
If this environment variable is set, \fBWireshark\fP will call abort(3)
if a dissector tries to add too many items to a tree (generally this
is an indication of the dissector not breaking out of a loop soon enough).
abort(3) will cause the program to exit abnormally; if you are running
\fBWireshark\fP in a debugger, it should halt in the debugger and allow
inspection of the process, and, if you are not running it in a debugger,
it will, on some OSes, assuming your environment is configured correctly,
generate a core dump file.  This can be useful to developers attempting to
troubleshoot a problem with a protocol dissector.

WIRESHARK_QUIT_AFTER_CAPTURE
.RS 4
Cause \fBWireshark\fP to exit after the end of the capture session.  This
doesn\(cqt automatically start a capture; you must still use \fB\-k\fP to do
that.  You must also specify an autostop condition, e.g.  \fB\-c\fP or \fB\-a
duration:...\fP.  This means that you will not be able to see the results
of the capture after it stops; it\(cqs primarily useful for testing.

WIRESHARK_LOG_LEVEL
.RS 4
This environment variable controls the verbosity of diagnostic messages to
the console. From less verbose to most verbose levels can be \f(CRcritical\fP,
\f(CRwarning\fP, \f(CRmessage\fP, \f(CRinfo\fP, \f(CRdebug\fP or \f(CRnoisy\fP. Levels above the
current level are also active. Levels \f(CRcritical\fP and \f(CRerror\fP are always
active.
.RE
.sp
WIRESHARK_LOG_FATAL
.RS 4
Sets the fatal log level. Fatal log levels cause the program to abort.
This level can be set to \f(CRError\fP, \f(CRcritical\fP or \f(CRwarning\fP. \f(CRError\fP is
always fatal and is the default.
.RE
.sp
WIRESHARK_LOG_DOMAINS
.RS 4
This environment variable selects which log domains are active. The filter is
given as a case\-insensitive comma separated list. If set only the included
domains will be enabled. The default domain is always considered to be enabled.
Domain filter lists can be preceded by \*(Aq!\*(Aq to invert the sense of the match.
.RE
.sp
WIRESHARK_LOG_DEBUG
.RS 4
List of domains with \f(CRdebug\fP log level. This sets the level of the provided
log domains and takes precedence over the active domains filter. If preceded
by \*(Aq!\*(Aq this disables the \f(CRdebug\fP level instead.
.RE

WIRESHARK_LOG_NOISY
