.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBCapinfos\fP is a program that reads one or more capture files and
returns some or all available statistics (infos) of each <\fIinfile\fP>
in one of two types of output formats: long or table.
.sp
The long output is suitable for a human to read.  The table output
is useful for generating a report that can be easily imported into
a spreadsheet or database.
.sp
The user specifies what type of output (long or table) and which
statistics to display by specifying flags (options) that corresponding
to the report type and desired infos.  If no options are specified,
\fBCapinfos\fP will report all statistics available in "long" format.
.sp
Options are processed from left to right order with later options
superseding or adding to earlier options.
.sp
\fBCapinfos\fP is able to detect and read the same capture files that are
supported by \fBWireshark\fP.
The input files don\(cqt need a specific filename extension; the file
format and an optional gzip, zstd or lz4 compression will be automatically detected.
Near the beginning of the DESCRIPTION section of wireshark(1) or
\c
.URL "https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man\-pages/wireshark.html" ""
is a detailed description of the way \fBWireshark\fP handles this, which is
the same way \fBCapinfos\fP handles this.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-a
.RS 4
Displays the timestamp of the earliest packet in the capture. The
earliest packet in the capture is not necessarily the first packet in
the capture \- if packets exist "out\-of\-order", time\-wise, in the
capture, \fBCapinfos\fP detects this.
.RE
.sp
\-A
.RS 4
Generate all infos. By default \fBCapinfos\fP will display
all infos values for each input file, but enabling
any of the individual display infos options will
disable the generate all option.
.RE
.sp
\-b
.RS 4
.sp
Separate infos with ASCII SPACE (0x20) characters.
This option is only useful when generating a table
style report (\-T).  The various info values will be
separated (delimited) from one another with a single
ASCII SPACE character.
.if n .sp
.RS 4
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
.B Note
.ps -1
.br
.sp
Since some of the header labels as well as some
of the value fields contain SPACE characters.  This
option is of limited value unless one of the quoting
options (\-q or \-Q) is also specified.
.sp .5v
.RE
.RE
.sp
\-B
.RS 4
Separate the infos with ASCII TAB characters.
This option is only useful when generating a table
style report (\-T).  The various info values will be
separated (delimited) from one another with a single
ASCII TAB character.  The TAB character is the default
delimiter when \-T style report is enabled.
.RE
.sp
\-c
.RS 4
Displays the number of packets in the capture file.
.RE
.sp
\-C
.RS 4
.sp
Cancel processing any additional files if and
when \fBCapinfos\fP fails to open an input file
or gets an error reading an input file.
By default \fBCapinfos\fP will continue processing files
even if it gets an error opening or reading a file.
.sp
Note: An error message will be written to stderr
whenever \fBCapinfos\fP fails to open a file or gets
an error reading from a file regardless whether
the \-C option is specified or not.
Upon exit, \fBCapinfos\fP will return an error status
if any errors occurred during processing.
.RE
.sp
\-d
.RS 4
Displays the total length of all packets in the file, in
bytes.  This counts the size of the packets as they appeared
in their original form, not as they appear in this file.
For example, if a packet was originally 1514 bytes and only
256 of those bytes were saved to the capture file (if packets
were captured with a snaplen or other slicing option),
\fBCapinfos\fP will consider the packet to have been 1514 bytes.
.RE
.sp
\-D
.RS 4
Displays a count of the number of decryption secrets in the file. This information
is not available in table format.
.RE
.sp
\-e
.RS 4
Displays the timestamp of the latest packet in the capture. The latest
packet in the capture is not necessarily the last packet in the capture
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
if packets exist "out\-of\-order", time\-wise, in the capture, \fBCapinfos\fP
detects this.
.RE
.RE
.sp
\-E
.RS 4
Displays the per\-file encapsulation of the capture file.
.RE
.sp
\-F
.RS 4
Displays additional capture file information.
.RE
.sp
\-h|\-\-help
.RS 4
Print the version number and options and exit.
.RE
.sp
\-H
.RS 4
Displays the SHA256 and SHA1 hashes for the file.
SHA1 output may be removed in the future.
.RE
.sp
\-i
.RS 4
Displays the average data rate, in bits/sec
.RE
.sp
\-I
.RS 4
Displays detailed capture file interface information. This information
is not available in table format.
.RE
.sp
\-k
.RS 4
Displays the capture comment. For pcapng files, this is the comment from the
section header block.
.RE
.sp
\-K
.RS 4
Use this option to suppress printing capture comments.  By default capture
comments are enabled.  Capture comments are relatively freeform and might
contain embedded new\-line characters and/or other delimiting characters
making it harder for a human or machine to easily parse the \fBCapinfos\fP output.
Excluding capture comments can aid in post\-processing of output.
.RE
.sp
\-l
.RS 4
Display the snaplen (if any) for a file.
snaplen (if available) is determined from the capture file header
and by looking for truncated records in the capture file.
.RE
.sp
\-L
.RS 4
Generate long report.  \fBCapinfos\fP can generate two
different styles of reports.  The "long" report is
the default style of output and is suitable for a
human to use.
.RE
.sp
\-m
.RS 4
Separate the infos with comma (,) characters.  This option
is only useful when generating a table style report (\-T).
The various info values will be separated (delimited)
from one another with a single comma "," character.
.RE
.sp
\-M
.RS 4
Print raw (machine readable) values in long reports.
By default \fBCapinfos\fP prints numeric values with human\-readable SI
suffixes, and shows human\-readable file type and encapsulation.
Table reports (\-T) always print raw values.
.RE
.sp
\-n
.RS 4
Displays a count of the number of resolved IPv4 addresses and a count of
the number of resolved IPv6 addresses in the file. This information
is not available in table format.
.RE
.sp
\-N
.RS 4
Do not quote the infos.  This option is only useful
when generating a table style report (\-T).  Excluding
any quoting characters around the various values and
using a TAB delimiter produces a very "clean" table
report that is easily parsed with CLI tools.  By
default infos are \fBNOT\fP quoted.
.RE
.sp
\-o
.RS 4
Displays "True" if packets exist in strict chronological order
or "False" if one or more packets in the capture exists
"out\-of\-order" time\-wise.
.RE
.sp
\-p
.RS 4
Display individual packet comments.  It is recommended
to print raw values (\-M) when using this option as
packet comments may include newlines and other special
characters.
.RE
.sp
\-P
.RS 4
Disable displaying individual packet comments.
.RE
.sp
\-q
.RS 4
Quote infos with single quotes (\*(Aq). This option is
only useful when generating a table style report (\-T).
When this option is enabled, each value will be
encapsulated within a pair of single quote (\*(Aq)
characters.  This option (when used  with the \-m
option) is useful for generating one type of CSV
style file report.
.RE
.sp
\-Q
.RS 4
Quote infos with double quotes (").  This option is
only useful when generating a table style report (\-T).
When this option is enabled, each value will be
encapsulated within a pair of double quote (")
characters.  This option (when used with the \-m
option) is useful for generating the most common
type of CSV style file report.
.RE
.sp
\-r
.RS 4
Do not generate header record.  This option is only
useful when generating a table style report (\-T).
If this option is specified then \fBno\fP header record will be
generated within the table report.
.RE
.sp
\-R
.RS 4
Generate header record.  This option is only useful
when generating a table style report (\-T).  A header
is generated by default.  A header record (if generated)
is the first line of data reported and includes labels
for all the columns included within the table report.
.RE
.sp
\-s
.RS 4
Displays the size of the file, in bytes.  This reports
the size of the capture file itself.
.RE
.sp
\-S
.RS 4
Display the earliest and latest packet timestamps as seconds since
January 1, 1970. Handy for synchronizing dumps using \fBeditcap \-t\fP.
.RE
.sp
\-t
.RS 4
Displays the capture type of the capture file.
.RE
.sp
\-T
.RS 4
Generate a table report. A table report is a text file
that is suitable for importing into a spreadsheet or
database.  \fBCapinfos\fP can build a tab delimited text file
(the default) or several variations on Comma\-separated
values (CSV) files.
.RE
.sp
\-u
.RS 4
Displays the capture duration, in seconds.  This is the
difference in time between the earliest packet seen and
latest packet seen.
.RE
.sp
\-v|\-\-version
.RS 4
Print the full version information and exit.
.RE
.sp
\-x
.RS 4
Displays the average packet rate, in packets/sec
.RE
.sp
\-y
.RS 4
Displays the average data rate, in bytes/sec
.RE
.sp
\-z
.RS 4
Displays the average packet size, in bytes
.RE
.SH "DIAGNOSTIC OPTIONS"
.sp
\-\-log\-level <level>
.RS 4
Set the active log level.
Supported levels in lowest to highest order are "noisy", "debug", "info", "message", "warning", "critical", and "error".
Messages at each level and higher will be printed, for example "warning" prints "warning", "critical", and "error" messages and "noisy" prints all messages.
Levels are case insensitive.
.RE
.sp
\-\-log\-fatal <level>
.RS 4
Abort the program if any messages are logged at the specified level or higher.
For example, "warning" aborts on any "warning", "critical", or "error" messages.
.RE
.sp
\-\-log\-domains <list>
.RS 4
Only print messages for the specified log domains, e.g. "GUI,Epan,sshdump".
List of domains must be comma\-separated. Can be negated with "!" as the first character (inverts the match).
.RE
.sp
\-\-log\-debug <list>
.RS 4
Force the specified domains to log at the "debug" level.
List of domains must be comma\-separated. Can be negated with "!" as the first character (inverts the match).
