.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBTShark\fP is a network protocol analyzer.  It lets you capture packet
data from a live network, or read packets from a previously saved
capture file, either printing a decoded form of those packets to the
standard output or writing the packets to a file.  \fBTShark\fP\*(Aqs native
capture file format is \fBpcapng\fP format, which is also the format used
by \fBWireshark\fP and various other tools.
.sp
Without any options set, \fBTShark\fP will work much like \fBtcpdump\fP.  It
will use the pcap library to capture traffic from the first available
network interface and displays a summary line on the standard output for
each received packet.
.sp
When run with the \fB\-r\fP option, specifying a capture file from which to
read, \fBTShark\fP will again work much like \fBtcpdump\fP, reading packets
from the file and displaying a summary line on the standard output for
each packet read.  \fBTShark\fP is able to detect, read and write the same
capture files that are supported by \fBWireshark\fP.  The input file
doesn\(cqt need a specific filename extension; the file format and an
optional gzip, Zstandard, or LZ4 compression will be automatically detected.  Near the
beginning of the DESCRIPTION section of wireshark(1) or
.URL "https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man\-pages/wireshark.html" "" ""
is a detailed
description of the way \fBWireshark\fP handles this, which is the same way
\fBTShark\fP handles this.
.sp
Compressed file support uses (and therefore requires) the zlib library.
If the zlib library is not present when compiling \fBTShark\fP, it will be
possible to compile it, but the resulting program will be unable to read
compressed files. Similarly, LZ4 and ZStandard also require their respective
libraries.
.sp
When displaying packets on the standard output, \fBTShark\fP writes, by
default, a summary line containing the fields specified by the
preferences file (which are also the fields displayed in the packet list
pane in \fBWireshark\fP), although if it\(cqs writing packets as it captures
them, rather than writing packets from a saved capture file, it won\(cqt
show the "frame number" field.  If the \fB\-V\fP option is specified, it
instead writes a view of the details of the packet, showing all the
fields of all protocols in the packet.  If the \fB\-O\fP option is
specified, it will only show the full details for the protocols
specified, and show only the top\-level detail line for all other
protocols.  Use the output of "\fBtshark \-G protocols\fP" to find the
abbreviations of the protocols you can specify.  If the \fB\-P\fP option is
specified with either the \fB\-V\fP or \fB\-O\fP options, both the summary line
for the entire packet and the details will be displayed.
.sp
Packet capturing is performed with the pcap library.  That library
supports specifying a filter expression; packets that don\(cqt match that
filter are discarded.  The \fB\-f\fP option is used to specify a capture
filter.  The syntax of a capture filter is defined by the pcap library;
this syntax is different from the display filter syntax described below,
and the filtering mechanism is limited in its abilities.
.sp
Display filters in \fBTShark\fP, which allow you to select which packets are
to be decoded or written to a file, are very powerful; more fields are
filterable in \fBTShark\fP than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax
you can use to create your filters is richer.  As \fBTShark\fP progresses,
expect more and more protocol fields to be allowed in display filters.
Display filters use the same syntax as display and color filters in
\fBWireshark\fP; a display filter is specified with the \fB\-Y\fP option.
.sp
Display filters can be specified when capturing or when reading from a
capture file.  Note that capture filters are much more efficient
than display filters, and it may be more difficult for \fBTShark\fP to keep up
with a busy network if a display filter is specified for a live capture, so
you might be more likely to lose packets if you\(cqre using a display filter.
.sp
A capture or display filter can either be specified with the \fB\-f\fP or \fB\-Y\fP
option, respectively, in which case the entire filter expression must be
specified as a single argument (which means that if it contains spaces,
it must be quoted), or can be specified with command\-line arguments
after the option arguments, in which case all the arguments after the
filter arguments are treated as a filter expression.  If the filter is
specified with command\-line arguments after the option arguments, it\(cqs a
capture filter if a capture is being done (i.e., if no \fB\-r\fP option was
specified) and a display filter if a capture file is being read (i.e., if a
\fB\-r\fP option was specified).
.sp
If the \fB\-w\fP option is specified when capturing packets or reading from
a capture file, \fBTShark\fP does not display packets on the standard
output.  Instead, it writes the packets to a capture file with the name
specified by the \fB\-w\fP option.  Note that display filters are currently
not supported when capturing and saving the captured packets.
.sp
If you want to write the decoded form of packets to a file, run
\fBTShark\fP without the \fB\-w\fP option, and redirect its standard output to
the file (do \fInot\fP use the \fB\-w\fP option).
.sp
If you want the packets to be displayed to the standard output and also
saved to a file, specify the \fB\-P\fP option in addition to the \fB\-w\fP
option to have the summary line displayed, specify the \fB\-V\fP option
in addition to the \fB\-w\fP option to have the details of the packet
displayed, and specify the \fB\-O\fP option, with a list of protocols, to
have the full details of the specified protocols and the top\-level
detail line for all other protocols to be displayed.  If the \fB\-P\fP
option is used together with the \fB\-V\fP or \fB\-O\fP option, the summary line
will be displayed along with the detail lines.
.sp
When writing packets to a file, \fBTShark\fP, by default, writes the file
in \fBpcapng\fP format, and writes all of the packets it sees to the output
file.  The \fB\-F\fP option can be used to specify the format in which to
write the file.  The list of available file formats is displayed by the
\fB\-F\fP option without a value.  However, for a live capture, you can only
specify a file format supported by dumpcap(1), viz.
\fBpcapng\fP or \fBpcap\fP. The \fB\-\-compress\fP option can be used to specify
a compression method as well; the list of supported compression methods
for writing can be displayed by the \fB\-\-compress\fP method without an
argument. If the \fB\-\-compress\fP option is not given, then the desired
compression method, if any, is deduced from the extension of the filename
given as argument to the \fB\-w\fP option.
.sp
When capturing packets, \fBTShark\fP writes to the standard error an
initial line listing the interfaces from which packets are being
captured and, if packet information isn\(cqt being displayed to the
terminal, writes a continuous count of packets captured to the standard
output.  If the \fB\-q\fP option is specified, neither the continuous count
nor the packet information will be displayed; instead, at the end of the
capture, a count of packets captured will be displayed.  If the \fB\-Q\fP
option is specified, neither the initial line, nor the packet
information, nor any packet counts will be displayed.  If the \fB\-q\fP or
\fB\-Q\fP option is used, the \fB\-P\fP, \fB\-V\fP, or \fB\-O\fP option can be used to
cause the corresponding output to be displayed even though other output
is suppressed.
.sp
When reading packets, the \fB\-q\fP and \fB\-Q\fP option will suppress the
display of the packet summary or details; this would be used if \fB\-z\fP
options are specified in order to display statistics, so that only the
statistics, not the packet information, is displayed.
.sp
The \fB\-G\fP option is a special mode that simply causes \fBTShark\fP
to dump one of several types of internal glossaries and then exit.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-2
.RS 4
.sp
Perform a two\-pass analysis. This causes \fBTShark\fP to buffer output until the
entire first pass is done, but allows it to fill in fields that require future
knowledge, such as \*(Aqresponse in frame #\*(Aq fields. Also permits reassembly
frame dependencies to be calculated correctly. This requires the ability
to seek backwards on the input, and as such cannot be used with live captures
or when reading from a pipe or FIFO.
.RE
.sp
\-a|\-\-autostop  <capture autostop condition>
.RS 4
.sp
Specify a criterion that specifies when \fBTShark\fP is to stop writing
to a capture file.  The criterion is of the form \fItest:value\fP,
where \fItest\fP is one of:
.sp
\fBduration\fP:\fIvalue\fP Stop writing to a capture file after \fIvalue\fP seconds
have elapsed. Floating point values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.
.sp
\fBfiles\fP:\fIvalue\fP Stop writing to capture files after \fIvalue\fP number of files
were written.
.sp
\fBfilesize\fP:\fIvalue\fP Stop writing to a capture file after it reaches a size of
\fIvalue\fP kB.  If this option is used together with the \fB\-b\fP option, \fBTShark\fP
will stop writing to the current capture file and switch to the next one if
filesize is reached.  When reading a capture file, \fBTShark\fP will stop reading
the file after the number of bytes read exceeds this number (the complete
packet  will be read, so more bytes than this number may be read).  Note that
the filesize is limited to a maximum value of 2 TB, although you might have
problems before then if the number of packets exceeds exceeds 232 (4294967296).
.sp
\fBpackets\fP:\fIvalue\fP switch to the next file after it contains \fIvalue\fP
packets.
This does not include any packets that do not pass the display filter, so it
may differ from \fB\-c\fP<capture packet count>.
.RE
.sp
\-A  <user>:<password>
.RS 4
.sp
Specify a user and a password when \fBTShark\fP captures from a rpcap:// interface
where authentication is required.
.sp
This option is available with libpcap with enabled remote support.
.RE
.sp
\-b|\-\-ring\-buffer  <capture ring buffer option>
.RS 4
.sp
Cause \fBTShark\fP to run in "multiple files" mode.  In "multiple files" mode,
\fBTShark\fP will write to several capture files.  When the first capture file
fills up, \fBTShark\fP will switch writing to the next file and so on.
.sp
The created filenames are based on the filename given with the \fB\-w\fP option,
the number of the file and on the creation date and time,
e.g. outfile_00001_20250714120117.pcap, outfile_00002_20250714120523.pcap, ...
.sp
With the \fIfiles\fP option it\(cqs also possible to form a "ring buffer".
This will fill up new files until the number of files specified,
at which point \fBTShark\fP will discard the data in the first file and start
writing to that file and so on.  If the \fIfiles\fP option is not set,
new files filled up until one of the capture stop conditions match (or
until the disk is full).
.sp
The criterion is of the form \fIkey:value\fP,
where \fIkey\fP is one of:
.sp
\fBduration\fP:\fIvalue\fP switch to the next file after \fIvalue\fP seconds have
elapsed, even if the current file is not completely filled up. Floating
point values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.
.sp
\fBfiles\fP:\fIvalue\fP begin again with the first file after \fIvalue\fP number of
files were written (form a ring buffer).  This value must be less than 100000.
Caution should be used when using large numbers of files: some filesystems do
not handle many files in a single directory well.  The \fBfiles\fP criterion
requires either \fBduration\fP, \fBinterval\fP or \fBfilesize\fP to be specified to
control when to go to the next file.  It should be noted that each \fB\-b\fP
parameter takes exactly one criterion; to specify two criterion, each must be
preceded by the \fB\-b\fP option.
.sp
\fBfilesize\fP:\fIvalue\fP switch to the next file after it reaches a size of
\fIvalue\fP kB.  Note that the filesize is limited to a maximum value of 2 TB,
although you might have problems before then if the number of packets exceeds
exceeds 232 (4294967296).
.sp
\fBinterval\fP:\fIvalue\fP switch to the next file when the time is an exact
multiple of \fIvalue\fP seconds.  For example, use 3600 to switch to a new file
every hour on the hour.
.sp
\fBpackets\fP:\fIvalue\fP switch to the next file after it contains \fIvalue\fP
packets.
.sp
\fBprintname\fP:\fIfilename\fP print the name of the most recently written file
to \fIfilename\fP after the file is closed. \fIfilename\fP can be \f(CRstdout\fP or \f(CR\-\fP
for standard output, or \f(CRstderr\fP for standard error.
.sp
\fBnametimenum\fP:\fIvalue\fP Choose between two save filename templates.  If
\fIvalue\fP is 1, make running file number part before start time part; this is
the original and default behaviour (e.g. log_00001_20250714164426.pcap).  If
\fIvalue\fP is greater than 1, make start time part before running number part
(e.g. log_20210828164426_00001.pcap).  The latter makes alphabetical sorting
order equal to creation time order, and keeps related multiple file sets in
same directory close to each other.
.sp
Example: \fBtshark \-b filesize:1000 \-b files:5\fP results in a ring buffer of five
files of size one megabyte each.
.RE
.sp
\-B|\-\-buffer\-size  <capture buffer size>
.RS 4
.sp
Set capture buffer size (in MiB, default is 2 MiB).  This is used by
the capture driver to buffer packet data until that data can be written
to disk.  If you encounter packet drops while capturing, try to increase
this size.  Note that, while \fBTShark\fP attempts to set the buffer size
to 2 MiB by default, and can be told to set it to a larger value, the
system or interface on which you\(cqre capturing might silently limit the
capture buffer size to a lower value or raise it to a higher value.
.sp
This is available on UNIX\-compatible systems, such as Linux, macOS,
\(rs*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, with libpcap 1.0.0 or later, and on Windows.
It is not available on UNIX\-compatible systems with earlier versions of
libpcap.
.sp
This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the \fB\-i\fP option, it sets the default capture buffer size.
If used after an \fB\-i\fP option, it sets the capture buffer size for
the interface specified by the last \fB\-i\fP option occurring before
this option.  If the capture buffer size is not set specifically,
the default capture buffer size is used instead.
.RE
.sp
\-c  <capture packet count>
.RS 4
.sp
Set the maximum number of packets to read when capturing live
data.
If reading a capture file, set the maximum number of packets to read.
This includes any packets that do not pass the display filter, so it
may differ from \fB\-a packets:\fP<capture packet count>.
.RE

.RS 4
.sp
Print a list of the interfaces on which \fBTShark\fP can capture, and
exit.  For each network interface, a number and an interface name,
possibly followed by a text description of the interface, is printed.
The interface name or the number can be supplied to the \fB\-i\fP flag to
specify an interface on which to capture.  The number can be useful on
Windows systems, where the interfaces have long names that usually
contain a GUID.
.RE
.sp
\-e  <field>
.RS 4
.sp
Add a field to the list of fields to display if \fB\-T ek|fields|json|pdml\fP
is selected.  This option can be used multiple times on the command line.
At least one field must be provided if the \fB\-T fields\fP option is
selected. Column types may be used prefixed with "_ws.col."
Prefixing the field name with an at sign (@) will display the data as hex bytes.
.sp
Example: \fBtshark \-T fields \-e frame.number \-e ip.addr \-e udp \-e _ws.col.info\fP
.sp
Fields are separated by tab characters by default.  \fB\-E\fP controls the
format of the printed fields.
Giving a protocol rather than a single field will print the protocol summary
(subtree label) from the packet details as a single field.
If the protocol summary contains only the protocol name
(e.g. "Hypertext Transfer Protocol") then the protocol filter name ("http")
will be printed.
.RE
.sp

(hexadecimal ef, bb, bf). Defaults to \fBn\fP.
.sp
\fBheader=y|n\fP If \fBy\fP, print a list of the field names given using \fB\-e\fP

the same character as the field values.  Defaults to \fBn\fP.
.sp
\fBseparator=/t|/s|\fP<character> Set the separator character to
use for fields.  If \fB/t\fP tab will be used (this is the default), if
\fB/s\fP, a single space will be used.  Otherwise any character that can be

.sp
\fBoccurrence=f|l|a\fP Select which occurrence to use for fields that have

.sp
\fBaggregator=,|/s|\fP<character> Set the aggregator character to
use for fields that have multiple occurrences.  If \fB,\fP a comma will be used

any character that can be accepted by the command line as part of the
option may be used.
.sp
\fBquote=d|s|n\fP Set the quote character to use to surround fields.  \fBd\fP
uses double\-quotes, \fBs\fP single\-quotes, \fBn\fP no quotes (the default).
If the quote character appears in a field value, it will be escaped
by being duplicated.
.sp
\fBescape=y|n\fP If \fBy\fP, the whitespace control characters (tab, line feed,
carriage return, form feed, and vertical tab) backspace, and the

Network interface names should match one of the names listed in "\fBtshark

be used.
.sp
If no interface is specified, \fBTShark\fP searches the list of

non\-loopback interfaces, and choosing the first loopback interface if
there are no non\-loopback interfaces.  If there are no interfaces at all,
\fBTShark\fP reports an error and doesn\(cqt start the capture.
.sp
Pipe names should be either the name of a FIFO (named pipe) or "\-" to
read data from the standard input.  On Windows systems, pipe names must be
of the form "\(rs\(rs.\(rspipe\(rs\fBpipename\fP".  Data read from pipes must be in
standard pcapng or pcap format. Pcapng data must have the same

Flush the standard output after the information for each packet is
printed.  (This is not, strictly speaking, line\-buffered if \fB\-V\fP

specified, as only one line is printed for each packet, and, as \fB\-l\fP is
normally used when piping a live capture to a program or script, so that
output for a packet shows up as soon as the packet is seen and
dissected, it should work just as well as true line\-buffering.  We do
this as a workaround for a deficiency in the Microsoft Visual C++ C
library.) This also sets \fB\-\-update\-interval\fP to 0 ms.
.sp
This may be useful when piping the output of \fBTShark\fP to another

see the dissected data for a packet as soon as \fBTShark\fP sees the
packet and generates that output, rather than seeing it only when the

This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the \fB\-i\fP option, it sets the default capture link type.
If used after an \fB\-i\fP option, it sets the capture link type for
the interface specified by the last \fB\-i\fP option occurring before
this option.  If the capture link type is not set specifically,
the default capture link type is used if provided.

\-Y|\-\-display\-filter  <displaY filter>
.RS 4
.sp
Cause the specified filter (which uses the syntax of read/display filters,
rather than that of capture filters) to be applied before printing a
decoded form of packets or writing packets to a file.  Packets matching the
filter are printed or written to file; packets that the matching packets
depend upon (e.g., fragments), are not printed but are written to file;
packets not matching the filter nor depended upon are discarded rather
than being printed or written.
.sp
Use this instead of \fB\-R\fP for filtering using single\-pass analysis. If doing
two\-pass analysis (see \fB\-2\fP) then only packets matching the read filter (if there
is one) will be checked against this filter.

\-z  <statistics>
.RS 4
.sp
Get \fBTShark\fP to collect various types of statistics and display the
result after finishing reading the capture file.  Use the \fB\-q\fP option
if you\(cqre reading a capture file and only want the statistics printed,
not any per\-packet information.
.sp
Statistics are calculated independently of the normal per\-packet output,
unaffected by the main display filter. However, most have their own
optional \fIfilter\fP parameter, and only packets that match that filter (and
any capture filter or read filter) will be used in the calculations.
.sp
Note that the \fB\-z proto\fP option is different \- it doesn\(cqt cause
statistics to be gathered and printed when the capture is complete, it
modifies the regular packet summary output to include the values of
fields specified with the option.  Therefore you must not use the \fB\-q\fP
option, as that option would suppress the printing of the regular packet
summary output, and must also not use the \fB\-V\fP option, as that would
cause packet detail information rather than packet summary information
to be printed.

Name Resolution (hosts)
.RS 4
.sp
Entries in \fIhosts\fP files in the global and personal preferences
directory are used to resolve IPv4 and IPv6 addresses before any
other attempts are made to resolve them.
The file has the standard \fIhosts\fP file syntax; each line contains one
IP address and name, separated by whitespace. The personal \fIhosts\fP
file, if present, overrides the one in the global directory.
.sp
Capture filter name resolution is handled by libpcap on UNIX\-compatible

on Windows.  As such the Wireshark personal \fIhosts\fP file will

Name Resolution (subnets)
.RS 4
.sp
If an IPv4 address cannot be translated via name resolution (no exact
match is found) then a partial match is attempted via the \fIsubnets\fP file.
Both the global \fIsubnets\fP file and personal \fIsubnets\fP files are used
if they exist.
.sp
Each line of this file consists of an IPv4 address, a subnet mask length
separated only by a / and a name separated by whitespace. While the address
must be a full IPv4 address, any values beyond the mask length are subsequently
ignored.
.sp
An example is:
.sp
# Comments must be prepended by the # sign!
192.168.0.0/24 ws_test_network
.sp
A partially matched name will be printed as "subnet\-name.remaining\-address".
For example, "192.168.0.1" under the subnet above would be printed as
"ws_test_network.1"; if the mask length above had been 16 rather than 24, the
printed address would be "ws_test_network.0.1".

Plugins
.RS 4
.sp
Wireshark looks for plugins in both a personal plugin folder and a
global plugin folder.
.sp
On UNIX\-compatible systems, such as Linux, macOS, \(rs*BSD, Solaris, and
AIX, the global plugin directory is \fIlib/wireshark/plugins/\fP (on
some systems substitute \fIlib64\fP for \fIlib\fP) under the main installation
directory (for example, \fI/usr/local/lib/wireshark/plugins/\fP). The personal
plugin directory is \fI$HOME/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins\fP.
.sp
On macOS, if Wireshark is installed as an application bundle, the global plugin
folder is instead \fI%APPDIR%/Contents/PlugIns/wireshark\fP.
.sp
On Windows, the global plugin folder is \fIplugins/\fP under the main
installation directory (for example, \fIC:\(rsProgram Files\(rsWireshark\(rsplugins\(rs\fP).
The personal plugin folder is \fI%APPDATA%\(rsWireshark\(rsplugins\fP (or, if
%APPDATA% isn\(cqt defined, \fI%USERPROFILE%\(rsApplication Data\(rsWireshark\(rsplugins\fP).
.sp
Lua plugins are stored in the plugin folders;
compiled plugins are stored in subfolders of the plugin folders, with
the subfolder name being the Wireshark minor version number (X.Y). There is
another hierarchical level for each Wireshark plugin type (libwireshark,
libwiretap and codecs).  For example, the location for a libwireshark plugin
\fIfoo.so\fP (\fIfoo.dll\fP on Windows) would be \fIPLUGINDIR/X.Y/epan\fP
(libwireshark used to be called libepan; the other folder names are \fIcodecs\fP

\fBTShark\fP uses UTF\-8 to represent strings internally. In some cases the
